Climate Impact on Crop Yield

This project incorporates Python-based data analysis and a simple machine learning task, namely linear regression, to explore the relationship between climate variables and crop yields in Denmark.

Data for crop yield downloaded from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL/metadata)

Data for climate and precipitation taken from NOAA (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/confirmation)
